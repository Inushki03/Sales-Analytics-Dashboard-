# 📊 Power BI Sales Analytics Dashboard  
**A Complete End-to-End Business Intelligence Project**

This Power BI project analyzes sales and customer behavior patterns using a retail dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
The dataset contains **1000 transactions** across **3 product categories**: Beauty, Clothing, and Electronics.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to design an interactive dashboard that provides insights on:

- Total transactions, revenue, and products  
- Product pricing trends  
- Monthly revenue and category performance  
- Customer behavior patterns (gender, age group, preferences)  
- Product category distribution  
- Sales quantity insights  
- Quarterly category trends & seasonal behavior  

The final result includes two main interactive dashboards:  
1. **Profit & Revenue Dashboard**  
2. **Customer Behavior Dashboard**

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing (No DAX Used)  
Before visualization, the dataset was cleaned using Power Query Editor:

### ✔ Performed Preprocessing  
- Removed null and duplicate rows  
- Standardized column names  
- Converted data types (Date, Numeric, Categorical)  
- Extracted Month, Quarter, and Year from Date  
- Created age ranges (Below 20, 20-29, 30-39, etc.)  
- Ensured product categories were consistent  
- Filtered irrelevant or inconsistent entries  

This means all calculations were done through **Power Query**, not DAX.
